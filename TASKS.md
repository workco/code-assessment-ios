# 1. Implement product detail screen

Implement the product detail page as shown in the Figma design file: [https://www.figma.com/file/TghrEZgi3nl3t3iZ72Ufmt/Code-Assessment-Final?node-id=14%3A129](https://www.figma.com/file/TghrEZgi3nl3t3iZ72Ufmt/Code-Assessment-Final?node-id=14%3A129)

Requirements:

- It should be possible to display a product by clicking it from the master product list.
- No animation is required when switching between active images in the PDP image picker
- Don't worry about wiring up quantity/add to bag buttons for this task
- Our data contains some placeholder.com images for certain image types. This is expected.
- **Bonus:** Build this screen such that it can be displayed from any arbitrary point during the application's lifecycle-- i.e. from a push notification, deep link, etc.

# 2. Make the quantity selection contol reusable

You may have noticed that the stepper control in each `CartItemCell` is built directly within the main application storyboard. Extract it from the `CartItemCell` prototype and replace it with your own custom stepper control class that can be used across the application without.

Requirements:

- Your control should mimic the existing stepper in appearance.
- You may do this entirely programmatically, or using a mixture of swift code and interface builder.
- **Bonus:** Add test coverage for your new control.


# 3. Connect the app to our API

Currently, our shopping cart app loads all of its data from a mock JSON file. You will replace this with calls to a real API, the documentation for which is here: [https://github.com/workco/code-assessment-api](https://github.com/workco/code-assessment-api).

Requirements:

- The app should load the list of products from our API. 
- Images should be loaded in the background to ensure smooth scrolling in the master list.
- You may use either the GraphQL or REST interfaces. We have made both functionally equivalent, so choose the protocol with which you are most comfortable.
- Errors should be handled and surfaced to the user. Presenting a `UIAlertController` with a description of the error that occurred will suffice.

# 4. Implement quantity increment/decrement on the cart screen

The cart screen currently includes a +/- stepper for each item in the cart, but it doesn't do anything. Modify the `Cart` class to implement cart quantity changes.

Requirements:

- When an item's quantity is reduced to zero, the user should be asked if they want to remove the item from their cart before the item is removed. You may use a `UIAlertController` for this prompt.
- The number in the stepper control should update based on the user's interaction.
- The app's unit tests should be updated to include coverage for the new functionality you have added.

# 5. Fix the Auto Layout warnings on the cart page

When navigating to the cart page on certain screen sizes, you will see conflicting Auto Layout constraint warnings printed to the console. These can impact performance negatively and often result in undefined layout behavior. Show us that you can resolve them.
